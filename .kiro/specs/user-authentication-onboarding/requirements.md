## Introduction

This feature implements a complete user authentication and onboarding system for CampusHub.

5. WHEN a user is on step 4 THEN the system SHALL allow interest selection and avatar setup
6. WHEN a user completes all steps THEN the system SHALL create the account and redirect to dashboard
7. WHEN transitioning between steps THEN the system SHALL use smooth animations and transitions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to smoothly onboard with as little typing as possible, mostly using list selects, dropdowns and other UI elements so that I can complete the process quickly and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is filling onboarding forms THEN the system SHALL use dropdowns, selects, and checkboxes instead of text inputs wherever possible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user filling out the onboarding form, I want my progress to be temporarily saved so that if I get interrupted or need to resume later, I don't lose my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts filling onboarding forms THEN the system SHALL store their input data in browser storage
2. WHEN a user returns to the onboarding process THEN the system SHALL pre-fill forms with previously entered data
3. WHEN a user successfully completes signup THEN the system SHALL clear all temporary storage data
4. WHEN 10 minutes pass without activity THEN the system SHALL automatically clear temporary storage data
